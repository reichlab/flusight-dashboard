The target data for the FluSight challenge is hospitalizations with influenza as reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN); this data is publicly available through the CDC's [Weekly Hospital Respiratory Data (HRD) Metrics](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Hospital-Respiratory-Data-HRD-Metrics-by-Ju/mpgq-jmmr/about_data) dataset.

For the evaluations, we have excluded predictions for two reference dates that were substantively impacted by NHSN reporting issues: 2024-11-23 and 2025-01-25.
